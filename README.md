This repositry contains binary releases of the One-Core-API project. These are compatible with Windows Server 2003 SP2, Windows XP SP3 and Windows XP
x64 SP2.

**Official Discord Server**: https://discord.gg/eRcGuFtn6p

**WARNING**
This is software that uses modified files from the respective systems, contains other files still in the testing or experimental phase and has only one developer. In other words, it is impossible to predict all possible scenarios on all possible types of computers or virtual machines. Between XP/2003 and Vista there was the biggest leap in new APIs, new technologies and modifications to existing APIs, so it is very difficult to have the same level of compatibility in NT5 as in NT6. Be calm, be prudent and before saying that this software is bad or "crap", report the defect in the issues and as soon as possible, it will be analyzed and I will try to correct the problem. Help me, complaining or defaming the software doesn't do anyone any good.

**Known Limitations:**
- Running Firefox 56+ you may face page loading problems. To resolve this, from version 55 to 72, you must create an environment variable called MOZ_FORCE_DISABLE_E10S . It will be the key of the user's environment variable, and the value will be 1. For versions from 73 onwards, the value will be the version number, that is, 73.0.0, for example (check the version number).
- Some places in dialogs or windows keep only in english. Internacionalization is working in progress. Some issues with installed mui packs;
- New applications installers may not work, like Chrome, Maxthon, Discord, Team viewer, etc crash and application isn't installed. Need 
use a pre-installed version, copied from other operating system;
- The packages cannot be integrate with nlite to Windows Iso, because use a tool called "SFXCAB Substitute", not standard Microsoft version;
- Standard .Net Framework Installers starting 4.6 ins't supported for now. You need a repacked version like did here: https://github.com/abbodi1406/dotNetFx4xW7.
